Instructions:1. Make sure you’re connected to the internet.2. Shut down any apps or browsers running on your computer and turn off Bluetooth. 3. Build a background profile.4. Build website profiles for websites you want to identify in your network traffic.5. Upload a network traffic trace (.pcap or .pcapng) then click “generate report” to see which of your profiled websites were identified in the trace.To generate network traffic traces, we recommend using Wireshark: www.wireshark.org/download.htmlAbout:	    This product was built by 5 senior CS students at Carleton College: Aiden Chang, Anders Shenholm, Jeylan Jones, Luke Mager, and Shaun Baron-Furuyama. Our goal was to design a system for determining which websites are present in a network traffic trace. After taking and examining many network traces, we concluded that IP addresses would be the most reliable and broadly-applicable indicator for websites we want to profile. Our project offers insight into how a malicious actor (i.e. person-in-the-middle) could gather information about one’s online activity even from encrypted network traffic. We also hope that it’s a fun, accessible tool that people can use to learn about the internet.
